/* Ov000_SetupMenuObjects -- Scene 1: bring up the menu scene's display objects.
 *
 * Copies the resource-tracker capacity table onto the stack and initialises the
 * scene's tracker (+0x10c) with it, registers the menu archive subfile #6, applies
 * tag 0 and caches the entries for tags 1 and 2. Then it builds two display objects
 * from six-word descriptors: the title object at +0x158 (character subfile #5,
 * palette #4, 2 cells) with both of its extra cells hidden, and the cursor object at
 * +0x3d8+0x4800 (character #2, palette #1, 0x15 cells) whose cells 2/3/1 are cached
 * and whose cell 1 is made visible.
 *
 * Subfile handles use the archive idiom already matched in Ov000_HandleLoadConfirm and
 * spelled as a macro in Ov000_LoadPageSubScreenLayer:
 *     ((base[0x21] + 0x8000 & 0x00fffffc) << 7) | 0x8000000N
 *
 * WHY THE THREE ADDRESS LOCALS ARE LOAD-BEARING, because it is not obvious and it is
 * the whole reason this function took a long time to match:
 *
 * mwcc rematerialises `base + constant` at every use, so `ctx`, `title` and `cursor`
 * produce EXACTLY the same instructions as writing `(char *)base + 0x10c` inline --
 * the same `add rN, r4, #imm` at every call site, byte for byte. What they change is
 * the size of the intermediate representation, and that turns out to matter.
 *
 * Written with the addresses inline, the function is byte-exact except for five words
 * in the SECOND descriptor block: the ROM computes the cell handle into r1 and stores
 * it to [sp] immediately, while mwcc computes it into ip and stores it one slot later,
 * after the [sp,#0x10] store. Nothing local to that block fixes it. What finally
 * identified the cause was a leave-one-out sweep over the whole function: deleting ANY
 * statement BEFORE the second block restores the ROM's schedule, and deleting any
 * statement AFTER it changes nothing. So the deferred store is a cumulative allocator
 * effect driven by the size of everything preceding it, not by the block itself --
 * which is why ~4000 compiled variants of that block (all 720 permutations of its six
 * assignments, all 720 of the first block's, 256 hoisting combinations, every capacity
 * spelling and struct layout, declaration orders, qualifiers, scopes, pragmas, compiler
 * flags and all 27 mwccarm builds) left the residue at exactly five words.
 *
 * Naming the three repeated addresses shrinks the expression tree by nine subtrees and
 * puts the allocator back under the threshold, at zero cost in emitted code. All three
 * are required: any one or two of them alone still leaves the five-word residue.
 *
 * The general lesson, worth more than this function: when a residue survives every
 * transformation of the code around it, stop varying the residue and bisect the
 * function for the construct that OWNS it. The owner routinely has no textual
 * relationship to the diff.
