/* Latch the pending request once, if the system is idle: only when Session_GetLocalPlayerIndex
 * reports free, the mode halfword at +2 is 1 and the latch at +0 is still clear.
 * Sets the latch, posts event 0x11, notifies ov023, sets game flag 0x2484 and
 * marks the session object's +0xe8.
 *
 * data_0204be08 and data_0204be08_params are the SAME address under two names,
 * and that is required, not cosmetic: the ROM's literal pool holds 0x0204be08 in
 * two separate entries, and mwcc emits two only for two distinct symbols. The
 * duplication is in the original too -- one view reads the block as scalar
 * fields, the other hands it to func_02031384 as a parameter buffer, which is
 * what the _params name records. */
